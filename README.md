# Customer Banking Application

This Python program is a basic customer banking application. It provides functionality for creating savings and CD accounts, calculating interest, and viewing the updated account balances based on the user inputs.

# Features

# Create Savings Account**
Users can input their initial savings account balance, interest rate, and the number of months. The program then creates a savings account instance, calculates the interest earned, updates the account balance, and displays the results.

# Create CD Account:
Users can input their initial CD account balance, APR (Annual Percentage Rate), and the length of months for the CD. The program creates a CD account instance, calculates the interest earned, updates the account balance, and displays the results.

# Calculate Interest:
Both the create_savings_account and create_cd_account functions internally calculate interest based on the user input.

# Display Results:
Results are displayed for both savings and CD accounts, showing the interest earned and updated account balances.
